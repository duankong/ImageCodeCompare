This is the opj_compress utility from the OpenJPEG project.
It compresses various image formats with the JPEG 2000 algorithm.
It has been compiled against openjp2 library v2.3.1.

Default encoding options:
-------------------------

 * Lossless
 * 1 tile
 * RGB->YCC conversion if at least 3 components
 * Size of precinct : 2^15 x 2^15 (means 1 precinct)
 * Size of code-block : 64 x 64
 * Number of resolutions: 6
 * No SOP marker in the codestream
 * No EPH marker in the codestream
 * No sub-sampling in x or y direction
 * No mode switch activated
 * Progression order: LRCP
 * No ROI upshifted
 * No offset of the origin of the image
 * No offset of the origin of the tiles
 * Reversible DWT 5-3

Note:
-----

The markers written to the main_header are : SOC SIZ COD QCD COM.
COD and QCD never appear in the tile_header.

Parameters:
-----------

Required Parameters (except with -h):
One of the two options -ImgDir or -i must be used

-i <file>
    Input file
    Known extensions are <PBM|PGM|PPM|PNM|PAM|PGX|PNG|BMP|TIF|RAW|RAWL|TGA>
    If used, '-o <file>' must be provided
-o <compressed file>
    Output file (accepted extensions are j2k or jp2).
-ImgDir <dir>
    Image file Directory path (example ../Images) 
    When using this option -OutFor must be used
-OutFor <J2K|J2C|JP2>
    Output format for compressed files.
    Required only if -ImgDir is used
-F <width>,<height>,<ncomp>,<bitdepth>,{s,u}@<dx1>x<dy1>:...:<dxn>x<dyn>
    Characteristics of the raw input image
    If subsampling is omitted, 1x1 is assumed for all components
      Example: -F 512,512,3,8,u@1x1:2x2:2x2
               for raw 512x512 image with 4:2:0 subsampling
    Required only if RAW or RAWL input file is provided.

Optional Parameters:

-h
    Display the help information.
-r <compression ratio>,<compression ratio>,...
    Different compression ratios for successive layers.
    The rate specified for each quality level is the desired
    compression factor (use 1 for lossless)
    Decreasing ratios required.
      Example: -r 20,10,1 means 
            quality layer 1: compress 20x, 
            quality layer 2: compress 10x 
            quality layer 3: compress lossless
    Options -r and -q cannot be used together.
-q <psnr value>,<psnr value>,<psnr value>,...
    Different psnr for successive layers (-q 30,40,50).
    Increasing PSNR values required, except 0 which can
    be used for the last layer to indicate it is lossless.
    Options -r and -q cannot be used together.
-n <number of resolutions>
    Number of resolutions.
    It corresponds to the number of DWT decompositions +1. 
    Default: 6.
-b <cblk width>,<cblk height>
    Code-block size. The dimension must respect the constraint 
    defined in the JPEG-2000 standard (no dimension smaller than 4 
    or greater than 1024, no code-block with more than 4096 coefficients).
    The maximum value authorized is 64x64. 
    Default: 64x64.
-c [<prec width>,<prec height>],[<prec width>,<prec height>],...
    Precinct size. Values specified must be power of 2. 
    Multiple records may be supplied, in which case the first record refers
    to the highest resolution level and subsequent records to lower 
    resolution levels. The last specified record is halved successively for each 
    remaining lower resolution levels.
    Default: 2^15x2^15 at each resolution.
-t <tile width>,<tile height>
    Tile size.
    Default: the dimension of the whole image, thus only one tile.
-p <LRCP|RLCP|RPCL|PCRL|CPRL>
    Progression order.
    Default: LRCP.
-s  <subX,subY>
    Subsampling factor.
    Subsampling bigger than 2 can produce error
    Default: no subsampling.
-POC <progression order change>/<progression order change>/...
    Progression order change.
    The syntax of a progression order change is the following:
    T<tile>=<resStart>,<compStart>,<layerEnd>,<resEnd>,<compEnd>,<progOrder>
      Example: -POC T1=0,0,1,5,3,CPRL/T1=5,0,1,6,3,CPRL
-SOP
    Write SOP marker before each packet.
-EPH
    Write EPH marker after each header packet.
-M <key value>
    Mode switch.
    [1=BYPASS(LAZY) 2=RESET 4=RESTART(TERMALL)
    8=VSC 16=ERTERM(SEGTERM) 32=SEGMARK(SEGSYM)]
    Indicate multiple modes by adding their values.
      Example: RESTART(4) + RESET(2) + SEGMARK(32) => -M 38
-TP <R|L|C>
    Divide packets of every tile into tile-parts.
    Division is made by grouping Resolutions (R), Layers (L)
    or Components (C).
-ROI c=<component index>,U=<upshifting value>
    Quantization indices upshifted for a component. 
    Warning: This option does not implement the usual ROI (Region of Interest).
    It should be understood as a 'Component of Interest'. It offers the 
    possibility to upshift the value of a component during quantization step.
    The value after c= is the component number [0, 1, 2, ...] and the value 
    after U= is the value of upshifting. U must be in the range [0, 37].
-d <image offset X,image offset Y>
    Offset of the origin of the image.
-T <tile offset X,tile offset Y>
    Offset of the origin of the tiles.
-I
    Use the irreversible DWT 9-7.
-mct <0|1|2>
    Explicitly specifies if a Multiple Component Transform has to be used.
    0: no MCT ; 1: RGB->YCC conversion ; 2: custom MCT.
    If custom MCT, "-m" option has to be used (see hereunder).
    By default, RGB->YCC conversion is used if there are 3 components or more,
    no conversion otherwise.
-m <file>
    Use array-based MCT, values are coma separated, line by line
    No specific separators between lines, no space allowed between values.
    If this option is used, it automatically sets "-mct" option to 2.
-cinema2K <24|48>
    Digital Cinema 2K profile compliant codestream.
	Need to specify the frames per second for a 2K resolution.
    Only 24 or 48 fps are currently allowed.
-cinema4K
    Digital Cinema 4K profile compliant codestream.
	Frames per second not required. Default value is 24fps.
-jpip
    Write jpip codestream index box in JP2 output file.
    Currently supports only RPCL order.
-C <comment>
    Add <comment> in the comment marker segment.
