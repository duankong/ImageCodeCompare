Usage: ./jpeg [options] source target
default is to decode the jpeg input and write a ppm output
use -q [1..100] or -p to enforce encoding

-q quality : selects the encoding mode and defines the quality of the base image
-Q quality : defines the quality for the extension layer
-quality q : use a profile and part specific weighting between base and extension
             layer quality
-profile X : encode according to profile X, X = a,b,c
             as defined in the JPEG XT standard. Without any parameter,
             the encoder tries to figure out the profile itself.
-r         : enable the residual codestream for HDR and lossless
             coding, requires -q and -Q to define base and
             enhancement layer quality.
-r12       : use a 12 bit residual image instead of an 8 bit residual
             image.
-rl        : enforce a int-to-int lossless DCT in the residual domain
             for lossless coding enabled by -Q 100
-ro        : disable the DCT in the residual domain, quantize spatially for
             near-lossless coding
-ldr file  : specifies a separate file containing the base layer
             for encoding.
-R bits    : specify refinement bits for the base images.
             This works like -r but in the DCT domain.
-rR bits   : specify refinement bits for the residual image.
-N         : enable noise shaping of the prediction residual
-l         : enable lossless coding without a residual image by an
             int-to-int DCT, also requires -c and -q 100 for true lossless
-c         : disable the RGB to YCbCr decorrelation transformation
-xyz       : indicates that the HDR image is in the XYZ colorspace
             note that the image is not *converted* to this space, but
             is assumed to be encoded in this space.
-cxyz      : similar to the above, but uses the dedicated C transformation
             to implement a XYZ colorspace conversion.
-sp        : use separate LUTs for each component.
-md        : use the median instead of the center of mass
             for constructing the inverse TMO of profile C.
-ct        : use the center of mass instead of the median
             for constructing the inverse TMO of profile C.
-sm iter   : use <iter> iterations to smooth out the histogram for
             inverse-TMO based algorithms. Default is not to smooth
             the histogram.
-ncl       : disable clamping of out-of-gamut colors.
             this is automatically enabled for lossless.
-h         : optimize the Huffman tables
-v         : use progressive instead of sequential encoding
             available for all coding schemes (-r,-a,-l and default)
-qv        : use a simplified scan pattern for progressive that only
             separates AC from DC bands and may improve the performance
-ae factor : define an auto-exposure value for part 7 profile B.
             By default, this factor is 0.6
-e exposure: define a manual exposure value for part 7 profile B.
             Auto-exposure, i.e. not using this parameter, is recommended.
-g gamma   : define the exponent for the gamma for the LDR domain, or rather, for
             mapping HDR to LDR. A suggested value is 2.4 for mapping scRGB to sRBG.
             This option controls the base-nonlinearity that generates the
             HDR pre-cursor image from the LDR image. It is also used in the
             absense of -ldr (i.e. no LDR image) to tonemap the HDR input image.
             Use -g 0 to use an approximate inverse TMO as base-nonlinearity, and
             for tonemapping with the Reinhard operator if the LDR image is missing.
-epsn eps  : define the numerator normalizer for profile B encoding,
             defaults to 1e-7
-epsd eps  : define the denominator normalizer for profile B endocoding,
             defaults to 1e-7
-lr        : encode the residual for profile B log-encoded, not gamma-encoded.
-gf file   : define the inverse one-point L-nonlinearity on decoding from a file
             this file contains one (ASCII encoded) digit per line, 256*2^h lines
             in total, where h is the number of refinement bits. Each line contains
             an (integer) output value the corresponding input is mapped to.
-z mcus    : define the restart interval size, zero disables it
-s WxH,... : define subsampling factors for all components
             note that these are NOT MCU sizes
             Default is 1x1,1x1,1x1 (444 subsampling)
             1x1,2x2,2x2 is the 420 subsampling often used
-sr WxH,...: define subsampling in the residual domain
-rs        : encode the residual image in sequential (rather than the modified residual)
             coding mode
-rv        : encode the residual image in progressive coding mode
-ol        : open loop encoding, residuals are based on original, not reconstructed
-dz        : improved deadzone quantizer, may help to improve the R/D performance
-qt n      : define the quantization table. The following tables are currently defined:
             n = 0 the default tables from Annex K of the JPEG standard (default)
             n = 1 a completely flat table that should be PSNR-optimal
             n = 2 a MS-SSIM optimized table
             n = 3 the table suggested by ImageMagick
             n = 4 a HSV-PSNR optimized table
             n = 5 the table from Klein, Silverstein and Carney:
                   Relevance of human vision to JPEG-DCT compression (1992)
             n = 6 the table from Watson, Taylor, Borthwick:
                   DCTune perceptual optimization of compressed dental X-Rays (1997)
             n = 7 the table from Ahumada, Watson, Peterson:
                   A visual detection model for DCT coefficient quantization (1993)
             n = 8 the table from Peterson, Ahumada and Watson:
                   An improved detection model for DCT coefficient quantization (1993)
-rqt n     : defines the quantization table for the residual stream in the same way
-al file   : specifies a one-component pgm/pfm file that contains an alpha component
             or the code will write the alpha component to.
             This demo code DOES NOT implement compositing of alpha and background
-am mode   : specifes the mode of the alpha: 1 (regular) 2 (premultiplied) 3 (matte-removal)
-ab r,g,b  : specifies the matte (background) color for mode 3 as RGB triple
-ar        : enable residual coding for the alpha channel, required if the
             alpha channel is larger than 8bpp
-ar12      : use a 12 bit residual for the alpha channel
-aR bits   : set refinement bits in the alpha base codestream
-arR bits  : set refinement bits in the residual alpha codestream
-aol       : enable open loop coding for the alpha channel
-adz       : enable the deadzone quantizer for the alpha channel
-all       : enable lossless DCT for alpha coding
-alo       : disable the DCT in the residual alpha channel, quantize spatially.
-aq qu     : specify a quality for the alpha base channel (usually the only one)
-aQ qu     : specify a quality for the alpha extension layer
-aqt n     : specify the quantization table for the alpha channel
-arqt n    : specify the quantization table for residual alpha
-aquality q: specify a combined quality for both
